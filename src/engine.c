 * engine.c - GPTPS engine: lifecycle, registry, queue, single-writer
 * dispatcher + worker pool, in-process executor, failure engine
 * (T2 + T4 + T5 + the in-process half of the executor seam).
 *
 * CONCURRENCY MODEL
 * -----------------
 * One mutex `m` guards all shared state. The DISPATCHER thread is the only
 * writer of the admission ledger (reserved_mem, running) and the only authority
 * for timing (deadline enforcement + retry backoff). Workers run tasks with the
 * lock released and post finished items to `done`; they never touch the ledger.
 *
 *   submit ─► [intake] ─► dispatcher admits the highest-PRIORITY item that fits
 *                          (running<conc && reserved+cost<=max), skipping a
 *                          too-large item to backfill smaller work behind it
 *                          (bounded reservation guards against starvation)
 *                                            ─► [ready] ─► worker runs
 *   worker  ─► [done] ─► dispatcher releases budget, then decides:
 *                          ok                -> free
 *                          fail & retries    -> [delayed] (re-admit after backoff)
 *                          fail & exhausted  -> on_failure: dead_letter|drop|requeue
 *
 * Timing: the dispatcher flips a running task's cancel flag when its deadline
 * passes (cooperative; in-process tasks must poll gptps_is_cancelled), and wakes
 * via cond_timedwait at the nearest deadline / backoff time. Event callbacks are
 * invoked with the lock RELEASED (never re-entrant under the engine lock).

/* The intake queue is kept in ADMISSION order - sched_score DESCENDING, ties
 * oldest-first - rather than submission order. The dispatcher then reads the item
 * it wants off the head instead of searching for it.
 *
 * WHY. Admission used to scan the whole queue twice per admitted item: once to find
 * the highest-scoring item that fits the live budget, once more to unlink it. Since
 * limits.max_intake_depth defaults to 0 - unbounded, and deliberately so, because a
 * host that submits its own work should not have gptps_submit start failing (see
 * docs/SECURITY.md) - a producer that outruns the dispatcher grows the queue to
 * O(n), which made admitting n items O(n^2). Measured with a no-op task, throughput
 * collapsed from ~110k items/s at a depth of 20k to ~4.4k/s at 160k; ordered intake
 * holds ~250k/s flat across the same range (tests/test_admission_perf.c).
 *
 * Sorting moves the cost to insertion, and an ordered insert that walks the list is
 * the same quadratic in a different place - so intake_runs caches the TAIL of each
 * equal-score run. Real workloads use a handful of distinct priorities, so the cache
 * answers virtually every insert and the splice is O(1).
 *
 * THE CACHE IS ADVISORY. A miss just walks for the insertion point, and
 * intake_forget() may be called at any time. The single hard rule is that no cached
 * tail may dangle, so every removal from intake either goes through intake_unlink()
 * - which repairs the affected run - or is followed by intake_forget().
 *
 * ORDER IS NOT A NEW POLICY. It is the order the old double scan already picked,
 * made explicit: highest score first, and within one score the oldest item, so FIFO
 * still holds inside a priority. tests/test_admission_order.c pins that. */
