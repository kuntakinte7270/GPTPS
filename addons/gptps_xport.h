 * gptps_xport.h - scale OUT by composition: N persistent worker PROCESSES, each with
 * its own address space, and - in engine mode - its own GPTPS engine.
 *
 * Where gptps_pool runs N engine shards inside one process, this forks N workers and
 * ships work to them over a socketpair. Two modes, chosen by what you put in the
 * config:
 *
 *   ENGINE MODE (gptps_xport_open_ex with `tasks`): every worker opens an engine,
 *   registers your task table, and runs whatever the link hands it THROUGH that
 *   engine. So the worker pool, the memory and named-resource budgets, retries,
 *   timeouts, dead-letter and the constraint/scheduler/observer seams all apply per
 *   worker process, exactly as they would in-process. Scaling out keeps everything
 *   GPTPS is for. The reply carries the item's terminal status (GPTPS_OK with the
 *   result on FINISHED; the failure status on DEAD_LETTERED / DROPPED; E_CANCELLED).
 *
 *   HANDLER MODE (gptps_xport_open, or open_ex with `run`): the worker runs a bare
 *   handler per request, one at a time, with no engine behind it. This is the
 *   original transport, kept unchanged for hosts that want plain crash-isolated RPC.
 *
 * The link is MULTIPLEXED: every request carries an id, a reader thread per link
 * matches replies to waiters, and up to `max_in_flight` requests may be outstanding
 * per worker (beyond that submit returns GPTPS_E_FULL - the same backpressure shape
 * as the core's limits.max_intake_depth). That is what makes engine mode useful: a
 * worker with 8 engine threads receives 8 concurrent requests, not one.
 *
 * Both blocking and asynchronous submission share that path:
 *   gptps_xport_submit()        blocks the caller until the reply
 *   gptps_xport_submit_async()  returns once the request is written; the reply
 *                               arrives on a callback
 *
 * What it still is not:
 *   - Not cross-host. Parent and child are the SAME forked binary, so the frames are
 *     native-endian and unversioned by construction - there is no second peer that
 *     could disagree. A cross-host transport needs gptps_remote's codec.
 *   - Not self-healing. A worker whose link breaks is retired for good; every
 *     request outstanding on it fails with GPTPS_E_IO. It is not respawned: the
 *     parent now has reader threads, and fork() from a multi-threaded process is
 *     only safe before those exist. gptps_xport_live() tells you how many remain.
 *   - POSIX only (fork + socketpair), like GPTPS_EXEC_OOP.
 *
 * Fork safety: gptps_xport_open* forks. Call it before your process starts other
 * threads (a forked child of a multi-threaded parent may deadlock on a lock some
 * other thread held). In engine mode the child opens a FRESH engine after the fork;
 * it never touches the parent's.
 *
 * Teardown: gptps_xport_close() is a graceful drain. It closes the request side of
 * every link; a worker in engine mode sees EOF, runs gptps_shutdown on its engine
 * (bounded by that engine's limits.shutdown_grace_ms - set it in `engine_cfg` if
 * the default 30s is too long for you), sends the remaining replies, and exits.
 * Blocking submits outstanding at close time therefore get real answers; async
 * ones get their callback. Only then are the readers joined and the pids reaped.

 * The callback runs on a thread the transport needs, so it must not wait on the
 * transport. The blocking gptps_xport_submit returns GPTPS_E_BUSY here, because the
 * reply it would wait for can only be delivered by a reader thread - this one,
 * whenever the request lands on the callback's own link - except in an io ==
 * GPTPS_E_IO callback, whose link is already dead and so cannot be waited on (a

 * that only this thread would read - hand large follow-ups to a thread of your own.
