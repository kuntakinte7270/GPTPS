 * gptps.h - GPTPS: General Purpose Task Processing System
 *
 * An embeddable, in-process C99 task-processing library ("the SQLite of task
 * processors"): link libgptps, register a task once, submit work, and the
 * engine runs it under per-task resource budgets and a failure policy,
 * auto-tuned to the host hardware. Task logic is supplied directly (in-process
 * C function pointers) or by add-ons loaded via the stable host-table ABI.
 *
 * STATUS: implemented and tested (Linux + macOS full; Windows core). This public
 * header is the one can't-reverse decision; everything else hangs off it - grow
 * it by APPENDING only (see ABI DISCIPLINE below).

 * ABI DISCIPLINE (read before touching any struct below)
 *   - All handles are OPAQUE; never expose struct layout to add-ons.
 *   - Every caller-extensible struct's FIRST field is `size_t struct_size`,
 *     set by the caller to sizeof(that struct). The core uses it to stay
 *     compatible across versions.
 *   - Structs may ONLY grow by APPENDING fields. Never reorder/remove/retype.
 *   - Bump GPTPS_ABI_VERSION_MINOR on additive change; MAJOR on incompatible.

 * change-watch, MANUAL mode (gptps_step), the allocator hook, runtime task
 * management, generic global + per-task settings; 1.9 added per-item constraint

 * child_setup and EV_DROPPED; 1.10 the generic named-resource budgets; 1.11
 * SERVICE tasks; 1.12 the pluggable scheduler seam.
 *
 * 2.x: 2.1 the plug-in tier seams; 2.2 appends `flags` to gptps_task_info, so a

 * it returns for any reason OTHER than a stop request it is automatically
 * RESTARTED after retry_backoff_seconds (crash-restart supervision). The engine
 * normalizes the failure policy for you (on_failure = REQUEUE, max_retries = 0,
 * no timeout). Start an instance with gptps_submit (start several for a pool); the
 * returned handle stays valid across restarts, so gptps_cancel(handle) stops that
 * one instance for good. gptps_unregister_task stops every instance of the type
 * (a DRAIN is auto-upgraded to CANCEL, since a service never drains on its own),
 * and gptps_shutdown stops them all. A service must poll gptps_is_cancelled() to
 * be stoppable - the same cooperative contract as any in-process cancel.
 * WHAT AN OBSERVER SEES. A service handle is a supervised LIFETIME, not a
 * completion, so it does not obey the one-terminal-event-per-handle rule a one-shot
 * does: each run emits its own STARTED and its own terminal event, and under the
 * default always-up policy a clean exit emits FINISHED and then restarts - a service
 * up for one second can emit a dozen. The single terminal event a service emits
 * exactly once is the FAILED carrying GPTPS_E_CANCELLED that gptps_cancel,
 * gptps_unregister_task or gptps_shutdown produces; that is the one to wait for if
 * you want "until this service stops". GPTPS_TASK_RETIRE_ON_OK is the exception: it
 * retires on a clean exit, so such a handle emits exactly one terminal event like
 * any other task.

 *      FAILED/GPTPS_E_CANCELLED for an item that never started -> the dispatcher,
 *        or, for one still queued, the thread that called gptps_cancel /
 *        gptps_unregister_task.
 *    In MANUAL mode every callback fires on the thread that called gptps_step().
 *  - Event callbacks (gptps_event_cb, observers) and the dead-letter drain
 *    callback ALWAYS run with the engine lock RELEASED, so they MAY call back
 *    into the engine (e.g. gptps_submit to retry) without deadlock. Keep them
 *    quick - a slow drain callback holds up the drain.
 *  - Constraint hooks (gptps_constraint_fn) are the EXCEPTION: they run on the
 *    dispatcher thread UNDER the engine lock, so they MUST be fast / non-blocking
 *    and MUST NOT call back into this engine (that would re-enter the lock).
 *  - In-process task bodies run with the lock released and must poll
 *    gptps_is_cancelled() to be stoppable (timeouts and gptps_cancel are
 *    cooperative for INPROC; OOP/PROGRAM are hard-killed at their deadline).
 *  - Settings write callbacks take their own lock; the fixed lock order is
 *    settings-lock -> engine-lock -> add-on lock.
 *  - gptps_shutdown() and gptps_step() are the exceptions to "callbacks may
 *    re-enter": both return GPTPS_E_BUSY when called from a task body or a
 *    callback, since either would tear down / recurse into the caller's own
 *    thread. gptps_unregister_task() does the same whenever the removal would
 *    have to wait for work of that type, which may need the caller's thread.
 *    Signal your main thread instead.
 *  - FORK: an engine must not be used in a child of fork(). Its mutex may be held
 *    by a thread that did not survive, so the child would deadlock; every entry
 *    point therefore returns GPTPS_E_SHUTDOWN on an engine created before the
 *    fork. A child that opens its OWN engine after forking is fully supported
 *    (that is how the gptps_xport worker-process add-on works).

 * EVENTS (observer surface; the core never aggregates - that's an add-on)
 *
 * EVENT ORDER IS NOT GUARANTEED ACROSS THREADS. The kinds below are emitted by
 * the threads listed under THREADING & REENTRANCY above - plus whichever
 * thread cancels a handle - and nothing serializes them against each other,
 * so an observer must key on the handle's CURRENT STATE and never on the
 * order events arrive in. Two inversions are real and reproducible today,
 * not theoretical:
 *   - QUEUED is emitted by the SUBMITTING thread AFTER the engine lock is
 *     dropped, and the dispatcher was already signalled while that lock was
 *     still held. A short task can therefore report STARTED - or even
 *     FINISHED - before its own QUEUED callback runs. The off-lock emit is
 *     deliberate: holding the engine lock across an observer let one slow
 *     sink stall all admission and dispatch, a far worse bargain than a late
 *     QUEUED.
 *   - A retry waits, unadmitted, while its RETRIED is delivered. A
 *     gptps_cancel() that lands in that window emits the handle's terminal
 *     FAILED / GPTPS_E_CANCELLED at once, on the calling thread, and so does
 *     a GPTPS_REMOVE_CANCEL unregister in MANUAL mode, or in THREADED mode
 *     when nothing else of that type is in flight. An observer still to see
 *     the RETRIED can therefore see the terminal event first. From another
 *     thread that is a race; a gptps_cancel() from a callback reacting to
 *     that very RETRIED makes it happen every time.
 * The races are RARE - each needs something to land inside an emit window -
 * and that is precisely why they must be designed for rather than discovered
 * in production: an observer that assumes order passes every test you write
 * and then loses your fastest items under load.
 *
 * WHAT IS ORDERED. Within one attempt, STARTED always precedes that attempt's
 * FINISHED or FAILED: the same worker thread emits both, in sequence. A FAILED
 * also precedes the RETRIED / DEAD_LETTERED / DROPPED the dispatcher derives
 * from it, because the worker finishes that emit before it hands the item to
 * the dispatcher's done queue. A bounded retry's RETRIED reaches every callback
 * and observer before that retry can be admitted, even with zero backoff, so the
 * next attempt's STARTED cannot overtake it. (Only a bounded retry emits RETRIED;
 * a REQUEUE cycle and a SERVICE restart re-admit without one.)
 *
 * MANUAL mode is the exception: a host that submits and pumps gptps_step() on
 * ONE thread sees the full per-handle order, since the QUEUED emit completes
 * inside gptps_submit before any step can admit the item - except that cancelling,
 * from inside a callback, a handle that is still queued or waiting to retry emits
 * its FAILED / GPTPS_E_CANCELLED at once, ahead of the triggering event for every
 * observer still to see that event.
 *
 * So read QUEUED as "this handle exists", not as "this handle is new", and let
 * an event that arrives first stand until its QUEUED catches up.
 * addons/gptps_stats.c is the worked example - a terminal event that outruns
 * QUEUED leaves a tombstone the late QUEUED then clears - and the one visible
 * cost there is that such an item has no queue-wait sample. An observer that
 * keeps latency must ACCOUNT for that rather than quietly drop it: the samples
 * lost this way are by construction the shortest waits, so dropping them pulls
 * the reported average up.

 * SCHEDULER SEAM (swappable admission ORDER; the mechanism stays in the core)

 * The dispatcher's mechanism is fixed and general: it admits the best-ordered
 * pending item that fits the live budget, skips a too-large item to backfill
 * smaller work behind it (no head-of-line blocking), and reserves for a
 * repeatedly-skipped top item so it cannot starve. What "best-ordered" MEANS is
 * the one policy knob - by default it is scheduling PRIORITY (higher first, ties
 * FIFO). Install a scheduler to replace that ordering key with your own discipline
 * (deadline-first, per-tenant fair-share, cost-aware, aging, ...) WITHOUT touching
 * the core: return a score for an item; the dispatcher admits the highest score
 * that fits, keeping all of the skip-to-fit / budget / starvation machinery.
 *
 * The hook returns an int64 score; the dispatcher admits the HIGHEST-scoring
 * pending item that fits the live budget (ties resolve FIFO). It runs on the
 * dispatcher thread UNDER the engine lock on the hot path, so it MUST be fast /
 * non-blocking and MUST NOT call back into this engine. `gptps_sched_input` and
 * `gptps_sched_fn` are declared up in the host-table ABI section (so add-ons can
 * install a scheduler through the routines table); check in->struct_size before
 * reading fields appended in a later minor.
 *
 * NOTE: a score should be a reasonably STABLE ordering key for a given item across
 * passes. The starvation guard charges "skips" to whichever item is currently
 * top-of-order, so a scheduler that returns wildly fluctuating scores for the same
 * item can spread those skips across different items and weaken the per-item
 * anti-starvation bound. Age-based aging is fine (it is monotonic); prefer a key
 * that only moves an item UP over time (e.g. -deadline, or priority + age).
 * ==========================================================================*/

/* Install (or, with fn == NULL, reset to the built-in priority ordering) the
 * scheduler. One per engine; a later call replaces the previous. A SETUP-time call
 * like the other seams - set it before submitting work / while quiescent.

 * unchanged behaviour, for a host that knows it is the only one installing. */

/* Install the scheduler, declaring an OWNER (ABI 2.1).
 *
 * The seam is SINGLE-SLOT by design, and that is not a limitation to work around:
 * an ordering key is a TOTAL ORDER, and a total order has one definition. Two
 * independent scorers cannot be composed - gptps_sched_fn returns an int64 on no
 * defined scale, so summing or chaining two of them produces an ordering neither
 * author intended, silently. It would also weaken the starvation guard, which needs
 * a stable top-of-order (see the NOTE above), and it would multiply an O(n)
 * under-the-lock cost by the number of installed scorers.
 *
 * So two definitions is a CONFLICT, and the core reports it rather than picking:
 *   flags == 0                   install only if the seam is FREE. GPTPS_E_BUSY if
 *                                it is owned, and the incumbent is NOT replaced.
 *   flags == GPTPS_SCHED_REPLACE take it regardless.
 * fn == NULL releases the seam back to the built-in priority ordering.
 *
 * `owner` is a borrowed, human-readable id - an add-on should pass its namespace
 * token - reported by gptps_scheduler_owner so an operator can see who holds it.
 *
 * AN ADD-ON MUST pass flags == 0 and fail its setup() on GPTPS_E_BUSY. The loader
 * then unwinds it cleanly and the operator gets a diagnosable "seam already owned"
 * instead of a policy that vanished without a word. Before 2.1 a second installer
 * silently replaced the first and both believed they held it - fine for a single
 * host, wrong for an ecosystem.
 *
 * If you want to INFLUENCE ordering without OWNING it, use the constraint seam:
 * GPTPS_DEFER with retry_after_ms reorders in time, composes by construction, and
 * is many-per-engine. That is the right answer for the second plug-in. */
